=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module allows you to convert the full name for a countries administrative
region to the code commonly used for postal addressing. The reverse conversion
can also be done.

Subcountry regions are defined as states in the US and Australia, provinces 
in Canada and counties in the UK.

Additionally, names and codes for all subcountry regions in a country can be 
returned as either a hash or an array.
