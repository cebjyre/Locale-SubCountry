DESCRIPTION

This module allows you to convert the full name for a countries administrative
region to the code commonly used for postal addressing. The reverse conversion
can also be done. Sub country codes are defied in "ISO 3166-2:1998,
Codes for the representation of names of countries and their subdivisions".

Subcountry regions are defined as states in the US and Australia, provinces
in Canada and counties in the UK.

Additionally, names and codes for all subcountry regions in a country can be
returned as either a hash or an array.
